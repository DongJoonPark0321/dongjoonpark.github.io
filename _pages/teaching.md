## Teaching Philosophy

Dong Joon Park strives to create an inclusive and engaging classroom that encourages critical thinking, dialogue, and collaboration. Drawing on reflective teaching practices and formative feedback, he designs assignments and activities that support students in connecting course content to real-world issues and their own lived experiences.

## Courses Taught

Social Inequality (University of Arizona, Fall 2022, online course)
-	Developed and taught an undergraduate course exploring class, race, gender, and labor market inequalities using multiple resources.

Introduction to Sociology (University of Arizona, Summer 2020-2022, online course)
-	An overview of core sociological concepts, theories, and methods, with a focus on how social structures shape individual lives and societal patterns.

## Teaching Interests
- Sociology of Education
- Gender and Work
- Race and Ethnicity

I look forward to developing and teaching graduate seminars, and mentoring students pursuing their own independent projects.
