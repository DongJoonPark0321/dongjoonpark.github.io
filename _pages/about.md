Dong Joon Park is a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at the University of Arizona, where he studies how structural changes in higher education and labor markets shape career outcomes, mobility, and inequality among doctorate recipients.
His research investigates the impacts of interdisciplinary research training, education–occupation alignment, and institutional diversity initiatives—particularly on women and international scholars. His work draws on large-scale survey data and has been published in Scientometrics, with additional articles under review at Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies and Asian Journal of Law and Society.
Dong Joon has taught undergraduate courses including Introduction to Sociology and Social Inequality, and he is committed to fostering inclusive, reflective learning environments that support diverse student needs. His long-term goal is to advance sociological understanding of how transformations in academia and labor markets influence equity, opportunity, and professional development.
